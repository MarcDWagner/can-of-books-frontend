# Can of Books

This repository has starter code to begin work on creating your own online bookshelf.

## What can books do?

Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. Build out this code base to create an web app to track what books have impacted you, and what's recommended to read next.

• How often will you take breaks?  **50:10**

• What is your plan if you start to fall behind? **Plan meeting before lecture**

### Cooperative

• Make a list of each person’s strengths.

o **Kenny:  coding knowledge/technical, communication**

o **Marc:  Communication, organization**

• How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?

o **Kenny:  Providing direction in code development**

o **Marc:  Keeping track of completed and upcoming tasks**

• In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?

o **Kenny:  Being able to explain what the code is doing and when, increase technical competency**

o **Marc:  Technical use and applying it to communication of front end to back end**

• Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?

o **The communication should be inherent in pair programming, space to ask questions, meeting briefly to discuss work for the day and meeting briefly before departing to discuss work that was done or needs to be done.**

### Conflict Resolution

• What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?

o **Issue will be addressed during pair programming or at either meeting, if need be, can be elevated to instructor for unbiased review.**

• What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?

o **Issue will be addressed during pair programming or at either meeting, if need be, can be elevated to instructor for unbiased review.**

• How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

o **We are going to talk about it, leave room to ask questions, and appropriately switch off driver/navigator.**
