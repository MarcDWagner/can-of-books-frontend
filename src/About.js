    <h2>Kenny Lino</h2>
    <p>My background is in linguistics and natural language processing. Now, I'm a full-stack web development student learning frameworks like React, Express and Node.js. I'm interested in combining my passion for creativity in order to make exciting apps that provide people with a positive experience.</p>
    <h2>Marc Wagner</h2>
    <p>I retired 2 years ago from the US Army and since then have been a project manager for a construction testing and inspection company.  I am a software developer because I enjoy problem-solving.  I specifically chose this field because it allows me to learn new things, always presents a challenge, and I will be able to grow professionally.  I am hoping to find a role in an environment where I can work with a small team and see projects from start to finish.  I have a lot of soft-skills leaders need to be effective; gained from years of managing and training increasingly larger groups.</p>
